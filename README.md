# language-context

This package adds support for the ConTeXt markup language in Atom, with syntax highlighting.

It was originally ported from an old [TextMate bundle](<https://github.com/pgundlach/context.tmbundle>), but the current version is converted from ConTeXt LMTX interface XMLs with the help of the included Python script and enhanced with information from the wiki.

See [here](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/) for details about ConTeXt.
