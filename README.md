# language-context

This package adds support for the ConTeXt markup language in Atom, with syntax highlighting.

It was originally ported from an old [TextMate bundle](<https://github.com/pgundlach/context.tmbundle>): it was ported using automatic *apm* conversion, but it has been (and it is being) refined and cleaned up.

See [here](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page) for details about ConTeXt.

## Install
Run the following command, or search `language-context` in *Atom settings -> Install*.

apm install language-context
```

(This will install the original, outdated version. The version of this repository is still unpublished.)

## Optional dependencies

It is recommended to install *TeX* language, via package `language-tex` or better `language-latex`, with the procedure explained before for better coloring on *TeX* primitives, and `language-lua` for embedded *Lua* code highlighting.
